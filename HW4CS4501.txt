Part 0
        It looks like the program is opening the file and adding up the values of the string in the function.
        If the remainder is a certain value, it copies the string to a buffer, which would cause an overflow in
        some instances.
        
        The security bug looks like it is a buffer overflow. When it is writing data to the buffer, it overruns
        the buffer's boundaries and overwrites adjacent memory locations

Part 2
        All ran on a VM for 10 mins:
                MOD_BASE = 10
                        29.5K(16 UNIQUE)
                MOD_BASE = 100
                         3462(16 UNIQUE)
                MOD_BASE = 200
                        1864(16 UNIQUE)
                MOD_BASE = 500
                        2135(18 UNIQUE)
                MOD_BASE = 1000        
                        438(16 unique)
        
        As MOD_BASE increases, the number of crashes generally decreases. The only ones that 
        do not follow this relationship is from 200 to 500. 
Part 3
        Done-image
        This part had more crashes compared to the one rain in part 1A.
